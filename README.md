# Introduction
This repo have many algorithms and data structure. Many of algorithms and data structure here can be found
in the book [Introduction to Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms).

In the folder src, here the source code. In each sub-folder of src is an algorithm and in each sub-folders have an
README file which explain the algorithm. Each algorithm can be found in C, C++ or/and Python. To run the unit tests,
is necessary run the command: `make run_tests`

# Dependencies
To manager dependencies in C/C++, we use the [CONAN C/C++ package manager](https://conan.io/) and is possible to install
all dependencies with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
